# PLAY

Tis repository is the software repository for the PLAY project. The GUI software aim to convert video game controllers (VGCs) input signal into MIDI and/or OSC messages.

The PLAY project investigates the creative possibilities of VGCs as human-computer interfaces (HCIs) for musical performance and composition. The aim is to transform VGCs into adaptive musical instruments, offering a new perspective on composing and performing virtuosic music, particularly for individuals without traditional instrument expertise.
